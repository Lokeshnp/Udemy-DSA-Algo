public static List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> myList) {
        Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new HashSet<>(myList);
        return new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet);
    }




This code defines a method called removeDuplicates that takes a List<Integer> as its argument and returns a new List<Integer> with duplicates removed. Here's an explanation of how the code works:



public static List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> myList) - This line declares the method signature. The method is public and static, meaning it can be called without creating an instance of the class it belongs to. It takes a List<Integer> called myList as its argument and returns a List<Integer>.

Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new HashSet<>(myList); - Inside the method, a new HashSet<Integer> called uniqueSet is created. The constructor of HashSet takes the myList as its argument, and by doing so, it adds all the elements from myList to the uniqueSet. Since a Set can only have unique elements, any duplicate elements in myList are automatically removed when added to the uniqueSet.

return new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet); - Finally, the method returns a new ArrayList<Integer> created from the uniqueSet. This line converts the Set<Integer> back to a List<Integer> while maintaining the unique elements. Keep in mind that the order of elements in the returned list might be different from the original list, as sets are unordered.



In summary, the removeDuplicates method takes a list of integers, removes duplicate elements from it by converting the list into a set, and returns a new list containing the unique elements.





Code with inline comments:



public static List<Integer> removeDuplicates(List<Integer> myList) {
    // Create a new HashSet with unique elements from myList
    Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new HashSet<>(myList);

    // Return a new ArrayList created from the uniqueSet
    return new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet);
}
