Pseudo Code:

Initialize additionalStack:

Create an empty stack called additionalStack.

Process the input stack:

While input stack is not empty, repeat the following steps:

Pop an element from the input stack and name it temp.

While additionalStack is not empty and its top element is greater than temp, pop the top element from additionalStack and push it to the input stack.

Push temp to additionalStack.

Transfer sorted elements:

While additionalStack is not empty, pop the top element and push it to the input stack.





Put in Simpler Terms:



Imagine you have a stack of books and you want to arrange them in order of their height, from shortest to tallest. But, you have no extra space, except for another pile that you can use temporarily.

Here's how you can do it:

Take the top book (let's say this is our temp book) from the original pile (stack).

Look at the top book of your temporary pile (additionalStack), if it's taller than the temp book:

Move it back to the original pile.

Keep doing this until you find a book that's not taller than the temp book or until the temporary pile is empty.

Then, put the temp book on the temporary pile.

Repeat steps 1-3 until your original pile is empty. Now, all your books are in the temporary pile, but from tallest to shortest.

Finally, move all the books from the temporary pile back to the original pile, one by one.



Now your books are arranged in the original pile from shortest to tallest!





Additional Hints for Understanding sortStack Method:



Purpose of the Method:

What is the goal of the sortStack method?

What will be the state of the original stack after running this method?

Helper Stack:

Why do you think an additional stack (additionalStack) is being used here?

When is it initialized and what is its role?

First 'while' Loop:

What condition is checked in the first 'while' loop?

What do you think will happen inside this loop?

Variable temp:

What is the temp variable for?

Why are we popping an element from the original stack (stack) and storing it in temp?

Second 'while' Loop (Inner Loop):

What is the condition for the inner 'while' loop?

Why do you think we have an inner 'while' loop inside the main 'while' loop?

Pushing and Popping:

What happens to elements that are popped from additionalStack?

Why are they pushed back into the original stack (stack)?

Placing temp:

When and why do we push the temp variable into additionalStack?

Final 'while' Loop:

Why is there another 'while' loop after the main 'while' loop?

What does it do with additionalStack?

Stack State:

After all these operations, what will the original stack (stack) look like?

How is it different from the original state of the stack?

Code Tracing:

Can you manually trace the code with a sample stack to see how each step is executed?
