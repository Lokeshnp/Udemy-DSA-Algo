public static String findLongestString(String[] stringList) {
        String longestString = "";
        for (String str : stringList) {
            if (str.length() > longestString.length()) {
                longestString = str;
            }
        }
        return longestString;
    }




The findLongestString method is designed to find and return the longest string in an array of strings, stringList.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

The method begins by initializing a variable called longestString as an empty string (""). This variable is used to keep track of the longest string that the method has come across as it goes through the array.

Next, the method uses a for-each loop to go through each string (str) in the array. A for-each loop is a simpler style of loop that goes through each item in a collection or array, without needing a counter.

Inside the loop, it checks if the length of the current string (str.length()) is greater than the length of the currently longest string (longestString.length()).

If the current string is longer, it replaces longestString with the current string (str). In this way, the longestString variable always contains the longest string that the method has encountered so far.

Once the loop has gone through all the strings in the array, the method returns longestString which now contains the longest string in the array.



So, the findLongestString method basically compares the length of each string in the array to find the longest one and returns that string.





Code with inline comments:



public static String findLongestString(String[] stringList) {
    // Initialize an empty string to keep track of the longest string
    String longestString = "";

    // Loop through each string in the input list
    for (String str : stringList) {
        // Check if the current string is longer than the longest one found so far
        if (str.length() > longestString.length()) {
            // If it is, update longestString to be this string
            longestString = str;
        }
    }

    // After checking all strings, return the longest one
    return longestString;
}
