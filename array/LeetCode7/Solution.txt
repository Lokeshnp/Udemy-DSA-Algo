public static int maxSubarray(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {

        int maxSum = nums[0];
        int currentSum = nums[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);

The maxSubarray function calculates the maximum sum of all contiguous subarrays in the provided array. This problem is a classic computer science problem known as the Maximum Subarray Problem.

The function uses the Kadane's algorithm, which is an efficient method to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(n).

Here is a detailed explanation:

If the array nums is empty, the function returns 0, since there are no elements to add together.

The function initializes two integer variables, maxSum and currentSum, with the first element of the array nums. maxSum keeps track of the maximum subarray sum encountered so far, and currentSum keeps track of the current contiguous subarray sum.

The function then loops through the array from the second element to the end (since the first element is already considered in maxSum and currentSum).

For each element in the loop, the function updates currentSum to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous currentSum. The function uses the Math.max function to choose the larger of these two options. This step essentially decides whether to extend the previous subarray or start a new one.

The function also updates maxSum to be the maximum of the current maxSum and currentSum, effectively updating the maximum subarray sum if a larger sum has been found.

After going through all the elements, the function returns maxSum, which by now holds the maximum sum of all possible contiguous subarrays of nums.



This approach works because it iteratively checks all possible subarrays by either extending the previous subarray or starting a new one, and keeps track of the maximum sum found so far.

This method is a dynamic programming approach because it breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems (the maximum sum ending at each position), and uses the solutions to these subproblems to find the solution to the larger problem (the maximum subarray sum overall).





Code with inline comments:



public static int maxSubarray(int[] nums) {
    // Check if the array is empty, return 0
    if (nums.length == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Initialize the maximum sum and current sum with the first element
    int maxSum = nums[0];
    int currentSum = nums[0];

    // Loop through the rest of the array starting from the second element
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Update the current sum to be the larger between the current number
        // and the current sum added with the current number
        currentSum = Math.max(nums[i], currentSum + nums[i]);
        // Update the maximum sum to be the larger between the old maximum sum
        // and the updated current sum
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }

    // After the loop, return the maximum sum found
    return maxSum;
}
