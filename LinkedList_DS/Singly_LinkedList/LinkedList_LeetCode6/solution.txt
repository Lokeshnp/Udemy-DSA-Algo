I've added some extra explanations there to guide you through it. Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ





    public void reverseBetween(int startIndex, int endIndex) {
        if (head == null) return;

        Node dummyNode = new Node(0);
        dummyNode.next = head;
        Node previousNode = dummyNode;

        for (int i = 0; i < startIndex; i++) {
            previousNode = previousNode.next;
        }

        Node currentNode = previousNode.next;

        for (int i = 0; i < endIndex - startIndex; i++) {
            Node nodeToMove = currentNode.next;
            currentNode.next = nodeToMove.next;
            nodeToMove.next = previousNode.next;
            previousNode.next = nodeToMove;
        }

        head = dummyNode.next;
    }




Given the list:
1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ 5.


With 0-based indexing, our goal is: Reverse nodes between indices 1 and 3 (inclusive) to achieve the result:
1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 5.



Detailed Walkthrough:



Preliminary Steps:

Check if the list is empty:

if (head == null) return;
We return right away if there's nothing in the list to reverse.



Create a dummy node:

Node dummyNode = new Node(0);
dummyNode.next = head;
The dummy node is a helper to simplify our code, especially if we have to reverse starting from the very first node.



Preparation:

Move to the node right before the start of the reversal:

Node previousNode = dummyNode;
for (int i = 0; i < startIndex; i++) {
    previousNode = previousNode.next;
}
In this case, for reversal starting at index 1, prev will now point to node 1 (at index 0).



Position current at the beginning of the reversal section:

Node currentNode = previousNode.next;
So, currentNode now points to node 2, marking the start of our reversal.



The Core Loop:

Perform the node reversal between m and n:

for (int i = 0; i < endIndex - startIndex; i++) {
    Node nodeToMove = currentNode.next;
    currentNode.next = nodeToMove.next;
    nodeToMove.next = previousNode.next;
    previousNode.next = nodeToMove;
}


Using our example, where we reverse nodes from indices 1 through 3:

First iteration (Reversing node at index 2, i.e., node 3):

nodeToMove = currentNode.next: Now, nodeToMove points to node 3.

currentNode.next = nodeToMove.next: Node 2 (our currentNode) now directs to node 4, leaving out node 3. Intermediate State: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 5. Node 3 (nodeToMove) stands alone.

nodeToMove.next = previousNode.next: Node 3 (nodeToMove) links to node 2.

previousNode.next = nodeToMove: Node 1 (previousNode) connects to node 3. Result:
1 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 4 â†’ 5.

Second iteration (Reversing node at index 3, i.e., node 4):

nodeToMove = currentNode.next: nodeToMove now points at node 4.

currentNode.next = nodeToMove.next: Node 2 now shifts to node 5, skipping node 4. Intermediate State: 1 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 5. Node 4 (nodeToMove) is free.

nodeToMove.next = previousNode.next: Node 4 (nodeToMove) links to node 3.

previousNode.next = nodeToMove: Node 1 (previousNode) connects to node 4. Result:
1 â†’ 4 â†’ 3 â†’ 2 â†’ 5.
Our target reversed order!



Finalization:

Realign the list head:

head = dummyNode.next;
If the original first node was part of our reversal, this ensures the head now rightly points to the list's beginning.



If you are having a hard time grasping this, I recommend illustrating with diagrams or using physical blocks and arrows which can oftentimes make it clearer.

Also, it might help to check the "Code with inline comments" below:





Code with inline comments:



public void reverseBetween(int startIndex, int endIndex) {
    // Check: If linked list is empty, nothing to reverse.
    // Exit the method.
    if (head == null) return;

    // Create a 'dummyNode' that precedes the head.
    // Simplifies handling edge cases.
    Node dummyNode = new Node(0);
    dummyNode.next = head;

    // 'previousNode' is used to navigate to the node
    // right before our sublist begins.
    Node previousNode = dummyNode;

    // Move 'previousNode' to node just before sublist.
    for (int i = 0; i < startIndex; i++) {
        previousNode = previousNode.next;
    }

    // 'currentNode' marks the first node of sublist.
    Node currentNode = previousNode.next;

    // Loop reverses the section from startIndex to endIndex.
    for (int i = 0; i < endIndex - startIndex; i++) {

        // 'nodeToMove' is the node we'll move to sublist start.
        Node nodeToMove = currentNode.next;

        // Detach 'nodeToMove' from its current position.
        currentNode.next = nodeToMove.next;

        // Attach 'nodeToMove' at the beginning of the sublist.
        nodeToMove.next = previousNode.next;

        // Move 'nodeToMove' to the start of our sublist.
        previousNode.next = nodeToMove;
    }

    // Adjust 'head' if the first node was part of sublist.
    head = dummyNode.next;
}
