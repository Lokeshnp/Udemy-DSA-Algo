Pseudo Code:

1. Start with a variable called 'num' and set it to 0.

   This will store our resulting decimal number.



2. Create a pointer called 'current' and set it to point to the start of the linked list (the head).



3. Begin a loop. Continue this loop as long as 'current' is not pointing to nothing (i.e., as long as we haven't reached the end of the list).



   a. Inside the loop, the first step is to double the current value of 'num'.

      This is like making space for the next binary digit.

      Imagine we are reading a binary number from left to right.

      Each time we move to the next position, we're shifting everything

      to the left, which is equivalent to doubling in the binary system.



   b. Add the value of the node that 'current' is pointing to, to 'num'.

      This value will be either 0 or 1 since it's a binary digit.

      Now 'num' contains the accumulated value up to the current binary digit.



   c. Move the 'current' pointer to the next node in the list to continue

      the loop for the next binary digit.



4. Once the loop finishes (we've processed all binary digits), return the value of 'num' which now contains the decimal representation of the binary number in the linked list.
